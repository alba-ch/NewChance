## Background 
This project has been developed in the three-day hackathon HackForGood at 42 Barcelona.

We were asked to choose a society problem to fix with a technological solution. There were very different areas in which we could offer help, but we made the decision to focus on improving people's quality of life by covering a need directly. 

Specifically, meeting the needs of refugees. For a good user experience, we contacted refugees and experts, asking them what help they most urgently needed, and finally came up with this app that sums up all of them.

## Technologies

### Languages
To develop the project, we have used:
- Java
- HTML5
- CSS3

### Software
To code the app for Android, we worked with **Android Studio**, and to design the UI/UX mockup, **Adobe XD**, because it allowed us to create a good looking mockup very quickly using plugins.
